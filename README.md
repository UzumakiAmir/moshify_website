# [Moshified Website Mock Up](https://moshify-uzumakiamir.netlify.app/)
### A website that mocks all of the features, animations, and components of moshified.com
This project helped refine my frontend development skills, utilizing HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. This project also required Adobe Photoshop. I created a web mockup, which helped me create a cloud hosting website from scratch. Great exercise in building a static website from the bottom up and using components, to build the elements of the site.
